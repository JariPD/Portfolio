You overlay a grid over the place where you want to calculate Then you assign values to the nodes in that grid. This algorithm uses a cost system: H cost = estimated distance from current node to end node, G cost = distance between current node and starting node and the F cost = G cost + H cost. After assigning values to the nodes you can calculate the shortest path between the start and end node.",
